# Create Vectors
```{r}
rain <-  c(3,5,7,9)
#making a vector and storing it in rain
rain_scaled <- 5 * rain
#this stores the scalar rain vector
```
for git messages, you want them to be concise, meaningful, and searchable

# Create matrices

```{r}
my_values <- seq(from = 1, to = 10)
#make a sequence
```

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
my_matrix
#create a matrix by using data. 'byrow = TRUE/FALSE' will show how the numbers are laid out
```

rm() code will take it out of our environment

```{r}
my_matrix2 <- matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
```
## matrix map
```{r}
matrixA <- matrix(data = seq(from = 2, to = 5, length = 10), 
                  nrow = 2, 
                  ncol =5, 
                  byrow = TRUE)
#making another matrix
```

```{r}
#adding or subtracting matrix
my_matrix + matrixA
```
#Matrix multiplication
